# About ![David](/static/img/david.png) & ![Karen](/static/img/karen.png)

We have a 200 ewe commercial Katahdin flock. 

The Katahdin is a hair sheep breed. The purpose of the breed is to efficiently produce meat. Katahdin are hardy, adaptable, low maintenance sheep that produce superior lamb crops and lean meaty carcasses. They do not produce a fleece and therefore do not require shearing. 

Our Katahdin flock fits neatly into the farm's operations because we can leverage a lot of the resources we already have with the cattle farm. 

## Food
The flock is fed our proprietary silage and feed recipe. The same recipe we use for the cattle. It's safe to say it's a crowd pleaser. They are quite loud if we come around and they think they won't be getting any! 

## Shelter
We converted our poultry houses into a barn which protects them against local predators and insulates them from the weather. So much so that when we open the doors to let them adventure, they don't want to leave (chuckle). 

The poultry house conversion also protects us from the dangers of interfering with the flock's social hierarchy and mating season. We can service each of the pens from the main thoroughfare down the center of the building, rather than entering each pen for our daily activities.
