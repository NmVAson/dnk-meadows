# About ![David](/static/img/david.png) & ![Karen](/static/img/karen.png)

We have a 200 ewe commercial Katahdin flock. 

The Katahdin is a hair sheep breed. The purpose of the breed is to efficiently produce meat. Katahdin are hardy,adaptable, low maintenance sheep that produce superior lamb crops and lean meaty carcasses. They do not produce a fleece and therefore do not require shearing.
